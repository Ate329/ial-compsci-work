# Chapter 9 - Algorithm design and programming
## Definitions
### Methods employed in algorithm design
1. **Abstraction**
    - Extracting information that is essential while ignoring what is not relevant for the provision of a solution, only including what is necessary to solve that problem.
2. **Decomposition**
    - Breaking a complex problem into smaller parts that can be further subdivided into even smaller parts until each part is easy to examine and understand, and a solution can be developed for it.
3. **Pattern recognition**
    - Identifying the parts that are similar and could use the same solution, leading to development of reusable program code in the form of subroutines, procedures and functions.
### Methods employed in programming
1. **Structured English**
    - Showing the logical steps in an algorithm, using an agreed subset of straightforward English words for commands and mathematical operations to represent the solution.
2. **Flowchart**
    - Showing, diagrammatically, using a set of symbols linked together with flow lines, the steps required for a task and the order in which they could be performed.
3. Pseudocode
    - Showing the detailed logical steps in an algorithm, using keywords, identifiers with meaningful names and mathematical operators to represent a solution.
4. **Stepwise refinement**
    - The decomposed parts to solve a problem are written as a series of steps where each step can be written as a statement in a high-level programming language.
### Identifier tables
| Identifier | Purpose |
| - | - |
| \<ident1\> | \<purpose1\> |
| \<ident2\> | \<purpose2\> |
## Quicknotes on common pseudocode syntax
1. Conditional statements using `IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF` and `CASE-OF-ENDCASE`
```
IF <condition>
    THEN
        <action1>
    ELSE
        <action2>
ENDIF
```
```
CASE OF <variable>
    "<value1>": <action1>
    "<value2>": <action2>
    ::
    ::
ENDCASE
```
2. Iteration with loops through `WHILE-DO-ENDWHILE` and `REPEAT-UNTIL`
```
WHILE <condition> DO
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
ENDWHILE
```
```
REPEAT
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
UNTIL <condition>
```
3. Counted interation with `FOR-TO-NEXT`
```
FOR <variable> <- <value1> TO <value2>
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
NEXT <variable>
