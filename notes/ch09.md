## Quicknotes
Quick notes on pseudocode syntax
1. Conditional statements using `IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF` and `CASE-OF-ENDCASE`
```
IF <condition>
    THEN
        <action1>
    ELSE
        <action2>
ENDIF
```
```
CASE OF <variable>
    "<value1>": <action1>
    "<value2>": <action2>
    ::
    ::
ENDCASE
```
2. Iteration with loops through `WHILE-DO-ENDWHILE` and `REPEAT-UNTIL`
```
WHILE <condition> DO
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
ENDWHILE
```
```
REPEAT
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
UNTIL <condition>
```
3. Counted interation with `FOR-TO-NEXT`
```
FOR <variable> <- <value1> TO <value2>
    <action1>
    <action2>
    ::
    ::
NEXT <variable>
